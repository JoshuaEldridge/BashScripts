# Home Video Archival
# Motivation: Several years ago I spent a lot of time extracting digital files from a collection of MiniDV tapes I'd recorded over the years.
# Worried about deterioration, access and loss I wanted to find a way to archive them for the long term. Originally, the files were captured
# using Apple software (assuming iMovie) so the DV streams were wrapped in an Apple container, which has served me well up to this point. However,
# accessing those files wasn't as easy as I'd like, and some additional curation was required to group the files, exact some light editing and
# tag the files with important metadata. 
# Goals: 1) long-term archival of the original source files and 2) ready access to files in a current format via a library like Plex
# Approach: Starting from the original capture files (e.g. Reel-1001-01.mov)
# 1) Migrate from the Apple container to a native DV stream
# 2) Split the resulting files into individual scenes, then group into "episodes"
# 3) Apply some light editing (mostly just removing throwaway sections completely)
# 4) Join "episodes" together and create a sustainable container (mkv) and compressed version for ready access in a video library
# 5) Tag files with metadata and archive the metadata for future use as well
